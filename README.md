# webchat

This is a project that I made in my free time last summer, it is not optimized at all.
I just wanted to experiment a bit to train overall skills.

For the frontend I used angular.
The backend is written in python/Flask, it handles database requests.
There also is a small part of server and client side code that i wrote in node.js,
it helps to update the website in real time.
